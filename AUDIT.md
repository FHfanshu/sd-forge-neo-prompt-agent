# Active Audit Log

Historical migration implementation remains available on branch `kt` and tag
`kt-final`. The concise archive index is in
`docs/archive/audit-archive-2026-07-19.md`; detailed working notes are
local-only under `docs/archive/`.

## 2026-07-21 Short Message Hover Action Layout

- Root cause: desktop user-message footers were absolutely positioned with both
  horizontal edges pinned to the message bubble. At specific viewport sizes and
  zoom levels, a short bubble therefore constrained Copy and Edit and resend to
  less width than their labels required, pushing or wrapping the controls out of
  the usable hover area.
- Changed `frontend/src/styles.css` so fine-pointer user-message footers size to
  their content and expand left from the bubble's right edge. Message actions and
  labels remain on one line. Existing hover visibility and narrow/coarse-pointer
  static layouts are unchanged. Added the CSS regression contract in
  `frontend/tests/window-interactions.test.ts` and rebuilt
  `javascript/prompt_agent_90_ui.js`.
- Verification: the focused window-interactions suite passed all 14 tests;
  Svelte check reported 0 errors and 0 warnings; the production build completed
  at 792.63 kB raw and 230.66 kB gzip. `python tools/test_gate.py affected`
  passed its acceptance preflight with 0 warnings/errors, all 111 selected
  frontend tests, and all 7 browser acceptance scenarios.

## 2026-07-20 Linux CI Portability And Cache Cleanup

- Root cause: the standalone Linux checkout did not contain Forge Neo's sibling
  `backend.args`, but a namespace test assumed the extension always lived inside
  the full Forge tree. A legacy-import test claimed to supply only an API-key
  marker while accidentally retaining the plaintext `api_key`, which invoked
  Windows-only DPAPI on Linux. Frontend checks and all browser scenarios passed,
  but `actions/setup-node` failed during post-job cache saving because pnpm's
  project-local store path was resolved from the repository root and did not
  exist there.
- Changed both backend tests to be self-contained and accurately exercise their
  intended boundaries. Removed setup-node's pnpm cache integration; the pinned
  install remains deterministic and took about four seconds in the failed run.
- Verification: both focused regressions passed, the CI-equivalent backend suite
  passed 93 tests with 0 skipped, and the full quality gate passed, including
  frontend checks/tests/build, bundle budget, all 7 mock-host browser scenarios,
  and all browser-script syntax checks.

## 2026-07-20 Message Hover Action Reachability

- Root cause: desktop message heading and footer controls were absolutely
  positioned outside the message card with an uncovered gap. Crossing that gap
  removed the card's hover state, and the message scroller intercepted clicks
  while the controls were still visually fading out. The heading also remained
  `pointer-events: none` after becoming visible.
- Changed `frontend/src/styles.css` so the heading/footer hit boxes include the
  visual spacing and both visible action bars accept pointer input. Added a CSS
  contract test and a real-browser regression that pauses in the former gap
  longer than the fade transition before clicking Edit and resend.
- Rebuilt `javascript/prompt_agent_90_ui.js`. The generated bundle is 756,494
  raw bytes and 218,421 gzip bytes, within budget.
- Verification: the focused Playwright regression passed; Svelte check reported
  0 errors and 0 warnings; all 146 frontend unit tests passed; affected and full
  quality gates passed; all 7 mock-host browser scenarios passed; all 6 browser
  scripts passed Node 22 syntax checks. `git diff --check` reported only the
  existing Windows line-ending warnings.

## 2026-07-20 Local Runtime Feedback And Agent Tool Enforcement

- Root cause: on-demand llama.cpp startup blocked on its readiness probe while
  the frontend exposed only the generic submitting state. Separately, named
  entity background questions used provider `tool_choice=auto`; the runtime
  enforced `edit_prompt` for mutations but had no equivalent lookup invariant,
  so Gemma4 could legally emit an unverified text answer without using tools.
- Added a sanitized local runtime status endpoint exposing only
  `idle/loading/ready/failed` and elapsed seconds. The chat working indicator now
  reports local model startup and weight loading, and cancellation/failure clears
  the watcher without leaving the composer disabled.
- Added a background-lookup gate for explicit named-entity/background questions.
  The provider is forced through `search_resources(kind=style)` and
  `inspect_resource(kind=style)` because local Forge styles are authoritative for
  character trigger words. It falls back to Danbooru only when no style matches.
  Unverified streaming text is hidden, successful inspection restores normal
  auto selection, and bounded corrective retries end in a visible failure rather
  than a fabricated answer.
- Fixed chat/settings interaction by preserving desktop/tablet floating windows,
  bringing chat to the front when its composer receives focus, and retaining the
  separate-view/focus-restoration behavior on phone layouts.
- Live Forge read-only verification returned exactly one local style for
  `moqing`; inspecting its logical ID returned the configured positive and
  negative trigger templates without exposing a filesystem path.
- Re-audited mobile acceptance chronology before changing layout code. The exact
  full-screen phone assertions dated to July 17, while the July 20 profile
  settings refactor explicitly replaced that behavior with persisted floating
  mobile layouts and added a CSS regression guard. Updated the stale mock-host
  E2E assertions to require an in-viewport, non-full-screen settings window;
  production CSS was not reverted to satisfy the obsolete expectation.
- Changed files include `backend/prompt_agent/{app,contracts,local_runtime}.py`,
  provider adapters, `frontend/src/agent/{agent-runtime,controller}.ts`,
  `frontend/src/{profile-api,providers/proxy-stream}.ts`, runtime/UI components,
  i18n, and focused Python/frontend tests.
- Verification: 88 Python tests and 144 frontend tests passed. Svelte check
  reported 0 errors and 0 warnings. The Vite build regenerated
  `javascript/prompt_agent_90_ui.js` at 756,574 raw bytes and 218,425 gzip
  bytes, within budget. All six Prompt Agent browser scripts passed `node
  --check`; all seven mock-host Playwright scenarios passed; `git diff --check`
  reported only existing line-ending warnings.

## 2026-07-19 Phase 9 Runtime Removal

- Removed the managed KT/Terrarium sidecar, installer/configuration, old
  provider runtime, frontend KT client, runtime controller, lease/claim paths,
  session ownership, queue/branch/replay runtime, and their contract tests.
- Removed the tracked legacy session sample and deleted local ignored sidecar
  state, SQLite assistant sessions, coverage reports, Playwright artifacts, and
  stale Python bytecode. The active tree does not contain `.loom`.
- Rewrote the active README and session design around Prompt Agent, Python
  profile/provider authority, Pi frontend state, and IndexedDB sessions.
  Historical migration documents are explicitly labeled as historical.
- Removed stale sidecar, queue, branch, and runtime-retry translations and the
  unused archived SSE fixture. The required KohakuTerrarium attribution remains
  because `LICENSE` and `test_kohaku_attribution.py` require it.
- Profile public projections expose configuration flags instead of local paths;
  local path and API key drafts remain component-local until explicit Save.
- Verification: Python compile and 39 Python tests passed before the audit
  archive split; 10 standalone browser contracts passed; Svelte check passed
  with 0 errors and warnings; focused profile/i18n frontend tests passed 21
  tests; mock Playwright passed all 6 scenarios. The full gates are rerun after
  this archive split and generated-bundle rebuild.

## 2026-07-20 Phases 3-9 Completion Audit

- Completed the single Pi runtime lifecycle, provider proxy, provider adapters,
  Forge Agent Tools, Python profile authority, and IndexedDB v2 session work.
- Root cause of the final Phase 6 failures: `ProfileAuthority` accepted only
  `Path` despite normal path-like callers, catalog output trusted extra internal
  fields, and server validation checked generation/patch containers without
  validating every nested value.
- Changed `backend/prompt_agent/profiles.py`,
  `backend/prompt_agent/forge_tools.py`, `backend/prompt_agent/app.py`, and
  `tests/test_forge_tools.py` to accept path-like roots, allowlist catalog
  projections, validate nested patch/generation values, and prevent upstream
  teacher error text from crossing the public API boundary.
- Added `/prompt-agent/api/forge-tools/validate`; the active browser host now
  revalidates prompt and generation tool arguments in Python before reading or
  mutating Forge DOM. Focused API and browser-host tests cover this boundary.
- Added effective provider capability projection in
  `frontend/src/providers/profile-capabilities.ts`. Unsupported capabilities
  are visible in profile settings, and `llama-once` cannot become the active or
  teacher agent profile while remaining available for local session/naming use.
- Added a real browser refresh regression: partial assistant content is durably
  stored, becomes interrupted after reload, a persisted stale tool call does not
  execute, no provider request resumes, and the next submission succeeds.
- Cleanup removed the orphaned `kohaku_loom/tool_args.py`, five unused UI export
  stubs, a duplicate test dependency, empty migration directories, and local
  bytecode/coverage/Playwright artifacts. Legal attribution and rollback/audit
  documents remain intentionally distributed.
- Regenerated `javascript/kohaku_loom_90_ui.js` from `frontend/`; raw size is
  754,078 bytes and gzip size is 215,832 bytes, within the configured budget.
- `python -m compileall -q backend kohaku_loom scripts install.py tools` and
  `python -m unittest discover -s tests`: 74 tests passed before the final
  active-tree marker guard; the focused architecture suite then passed 3 tests.
- `python tools/test_runner.py --max-skips 20`: 74 tests passed with 0 skipped.
- Python branch coverage gate: 76%, above the required 70%.
- Frontend Svelte check: 0 errors and 0 warnings. Frontend coverage: 120 tests
  passed across 20 files with 87.22% statement coverage.
- Frontend build, bundle budget, seven mock-host Playwright scenarios, and
  `node --check javascript/kohaku_loom*.js` passed.
- Active-tree dependency audit found no archived sidecar, lease, ownership,
  queue, branch, replay, or provider-runtime execution path. An API-registration
  startup sentinel reported `.loom` absent before and after registration. A
  permanent architecture test now enforces the archived-runtime marker budget.
- Remaining risk: real Forge/provider/local-model smoke tests require external
  running services and credentials. Phase 10 naming remains blocked by the
  licensing decision and remote repository administration.

## 2026-07-20 Frontend Prompt Agent Naming And Storage Migration

- Root cause: the active hand-authored frontend still exposed archived Kohaku
  Loom branding through bridge globals, DOM hooks, CSS prefixes, i18n routes,
  UI labels, and persisted localStorage keys even after the runtime and API had
  moved to Prompt Agent.
- Changed the scoped frontend source and tests, `frontend/index.html`,
  `frontend/tailwind.config.ts`, and `frontend/README.md` to use Prompt Agent
  identifiers, including `PromptAgentActionHandlers`, `PromptAgentStore`,
  `prompt-agent-host`, `prompt-agent-ui`, `data-prompt-agent-*`, `pa-*`, and
  `/prompt-agent/api/i18n`.
- Added `frontend/src/storage-migrations.ts` and
  `frontend/tests/storage-migrations.test.ts`. Reads prefer canonical Prompt
  Agent keys and migrate each legacy value once; writes and removals touch only
  canonical keys and remove stale legacy values. No secrets or raw user content
  were added to the audit.
- Generated browser output under `javascript/` was not edited or rebuilt. The
  existing unrelated worktree changes outside this scoped frontend increment
  were preserved.
- Verification: pinned Node `22.17.0` / pnpm `10.12.4` returned the expected
  versions; `pnpm run check` found 0 errors and 0 warnings; `pnpm run test`
  passed 21 files and 123 tests; scoped `git diff --check` passed; scoped
  legacy-identifier search found only the six intentional compatibility keys in
  `LEGACY_STORAGE_KEYS`.
- Residual risk: the roadmap's full distributed naming migration remains gated
  by the licensing decision; the six old storage key literals must remain until
  their compatibility migration window is intentionally retired.

## 2026-07-20 Phase 10 Technical Naming Completion

- Completed the active technical rename to Prompt Agent across the Python
  package and Forge script, `/prompt-agent/api` routes, browser filenames and
  namespace, bridge names, browser events, DOM/data identifiers, `pa-*` CSS,
  package metadata, generated asset, tests, and active documentation.
- Removed the runtime `window.kohakuLoom` and `window.KohakuLoomSvelteUi`
  aliases. Shared browser state is authoritative only at
  `window.__SD_FORGE_NEO_PROMPT_AGENT__`; the generated UI is exposed as its
  `ui` property.
- Preserved shipped UI preferences through canonical-first, one-time migration
  of locale, layouts, launcher position, favorites, and recents. The old keys
  are isolated compatibility literals; all writes use Prompt Agent keys.
- Preserved the required visible KohakuTerrarium attribution and root license.
  Added `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` for KohakuTerrarium, Pi 0.74.2, and TypeBox
  1.1.24. The technical rename does not relicense the repository: release under
  Prompt Agent-only branding, an MIT relicensing, and remote repository rename
  remain gated by copyright permission or independent-licensing evidence.
- Added an active-tree architecture guard against archived technical names,
  with narrow exceptions for historical/legal records, negative assertions,
  and one-time storage migration constants.
- Startup verification found that `prompt_agent/reference_image.py` still
  imported a deleted assistant-model constant. Removed the dead fallback and
  added import, reference-image message, API registration, and `.loom`
  non-creation regression coverage.
- Verification: Python compile passed; 79 tests passed with 0 skips; Python
  branch coverage was 73%, above the 70% gate. Svelte check reported 0 errors
  and 0 warnings; frontend coverage passed 123 tests across 21 files at 87.33%
  statements. Eleven root browser contracts and seven Chromium Playwright
  scenarios passed.
- Vite generated `javascript/prompt_agent_90_ui.js` at 755,214 raw bytes and
  216,261 gzip bytes, within budget. All six Prompt Agent browser scripts passed
  `node --check`; `git diff --check` reported only line-ending warnings.
- The isolated Forge registration sentinel reported
  `before=False after=False callback=prompt-agent-api callbacks=1`.
- Residual risk: real Forge, provider, and local-model smoke tests still require
  running external services and credentials. GitHub repository rename, default
  branch changes, and old remote branch handling require repository admin
  access. No migration change has been committed or pushed.

## 2026-07-20 Minimalist Frontend Refresh

- Root cause: `frontend/src/styles.css` carried two competing visual systems —
  a decorative glass/warm-tone layer and a later Forge-native override block —
  defining the same selectors twice, with hard-coded light/translucent colors
  hostile to dark themes and the file at the 1000-line source limit.
- Consolidated `styles.css` into a single token-first Forge-native stylesheet
  (1000 -> ~540 lines): all colors map to Gradio/Forge variables, one accent
  (`--primary-500`), removed dead rules for unused classes (legacy reasoning
  slider/popover, queue strip, risk pills, brand orb, profile quick/advanced
  cards, and similar), and merged the three responsive blocks.
- `selector-styles.css` now consumes shared radius/shadow tokens; no Svelte
  markup changes were required (verified every used `pa-*` class is styled).
- Changed files: `frontend/src/styles.css`, `frontend/src/selector-styles.css`,
  regenerated `javascript/prompt_agent_90_ui.js`.
- Verification: `pnpm run check` 0 errors/0 warnings; `pnpm run test` 123
  passed across 21 files (includes the two CSS-string assertions);
  `pnpm run build` succeeded (741 kB bundle); `node --check` passed for all
  Prompt Agent browser scripts; `python -m unittest discover -s tests` 79
  passed. Light/dark Forge theme smoke check in a live UI remains a manual
  follow-up.

## 2026-07-20 Repository Hygiene

- Root cause: ignored Python bytecode, coverage data, frontend dependencies,
  package caches, and Playwright results had accumulated in the working tree;
  two detailed historical migration documents also duplicated history already
  retained by `kt`, `kt-final`, and the concise tracked archive.
- Removed local generated and test artifacts while preserving `data/`, which
  contains local profile and secret state. Kept all active source, runtime,
  build, and test directories.
- Changed `.gitignore`; stopped tracking `docs/KOHAKU_LOOM_MIGRATION.md` and
  `docs/audit-archive-2026-07-19-full.md` while retaining both local copies.
- Verification: `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python -m unittest discover -s
  tests` passed 79 tests, the focused architecture suite passed 4 tests,
  staged and scoped `git diff --check` passed, and the final ignored-artifact
  dry run was empty outside the preserved local files. Standard `git gc`
  reduced loose-object storage from 12.60 MiB to 235 bytes without integrity
  errors.

## 2026-07-20 MIT Relicense And Attribution Cleanup

- Root cause: the active tree no longer ships the KT/Terrarium runtime, but
  root `LICENSE`, README, UI attribution, and `test_kohaku_attribution.py`
  still enforced KohakuTerrarium naming and visible attribution as a release
  gate.
- Decision: relicense the active product under MIT as repository owner; keep
  branch `kt` and tag `kt-final` as a frozen historical lesson without
  rewriting Git history.
- Changed `LICENSE` to MIT; rewrote `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` for Pi and TypeBox
  only; updated README, ROADMAP Phase 10, and `docs/kt-runtime-migration.md`
  licensing text; removed the Profile Settings "Powered by KohakuTerrarium"
  menu item; dropped `profiles.powered_by` locale strings; deleted
  `tests/test_kohaku_attribution.py` and its architecture allowlist entry.
- Verification: `python -m unittest tests.test_i18n tests.test_architecture -v`
  passed 10 tests; full `python -m unittest discover -s tests` passed 78 tests;
  frontend `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm run build`, and
  `pnpm run check` passed (0 errors/warnings; regenerated
  `javascript/prompt_agent_90_ui.js`); `node --check` passed for browser
  scripts. Active tree no longer contains KohakuTerrarium attribution strings
  in LICENSE, README, Profile Settings, or locale catalogs. Branch `kt` and tag
  `kt-final` were intentionally kept.

## 2026-07-20 Docs And Tools Layout Cleanup

- Root cause: active docs mixed product guides with KT migration history, and a
  one-file `tools/` package only held the skip-budget test runner.
- Moved historical docs into `docs/archive/` with a short index README; kept
  active `docs/SESSION_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` and `docs/DANBOORU_TAGS_AGENT.md`.
  Local-only detailed archives remain gitignored under `docs/archive/`.
- Moved `tools/test_runner.py` to `tests/run_suite.py` and removed empty
  `tools/`; updated README, CI compile/test commands, ROADMAP phase-1 paths,
  and architecture historical-file allowlist.
- Verification: `python -m compileall -q backend prompt_agent scripts install.py
  tests` passed; `python tests/run_suite.py --max-skips 20` passed 78 tests with
  0 skipped; `python -m unittest tests.test_architecture -v` passed 4 tests.

## 2026-07-20 README Tools List And Partial CI

- Updated README with layout, the 12 agent-exposed Forge tools, and tiered
  local verification commands (fast / frontend / full).
- CI path filters: backend jobs skip when only frontend changes and vice versa.
  PR backend matrix is Python 3.12 only; main/manual keep 3.11–3.13. Coverage
  artifacts stay main/manual. Browser-script syntax merged into the frontend
  job. Concurrency cancels superseded runs.

## 2026-07-20 Agent Tool Surface Revision

- Removed `ask_teacher` from the agent tool registry, Python validation names,
  forge-tools API execution path, and host dispatch (explicit rejection remains).
- Registered Danbooru tools already implemented by the resource host:
  `search_danbooru_tags`, `inspect_danbooru_tag`, `inspect_danbooru_tags`,
  `related_danbooru_tags`.
- Host `edit_prompt` / `edit_negative_prompt` now allow full `prompt` overwrite
  only when the current field is empty; non-empty fields require patches/diff.
- Updated Anima skill mix guidance, system prompt, README, ROADMAP Phase 6,
  and focused Python/frontend tool tests.
- Verification: `python -m unittest tests.test_forge_tools tests.test_architecture`
  passed 13 tests; frontend vitest 123 passed; `node --check javascript/prompt_agent.js`
  and `node --test tests/test_frontend_resources.js` passed; rebuilt
  `javascript/prompt_agent_90_ui.js`.

## 2026-07-20 Agent Tool Compression

- Reduced the model-visible surface from 15 tools to 9 without removing
  capabilities. Positive/negative prompt tools now share `field`; Forge
  resources share `kind`; single Danbooru inspection uses a one-item `names`
  array in the existing batch tool.
- Model and embedding catalogs route through the Python logical-ID projection;
  styles, wildcards, and LoRAs continue through the Forge resource API.
- Removed the now-unused browser forge-tools POST client and updated schemas,
  validation, host dispatch, docs, and regression tests.
- Verification: `python tests/run_suite.py --max-skips 20` passed 78 tests with
  0 skipped; frontend `pnpm run test` passed 123 tests and `pnpm run check`
  reported 0 errors/warnings; browser contracts passed 11 tests; all Prompt
  Agent scripts passed `node --check`; Vite build and bundle-size passed
  (740,340 raw / 213,867 gzip bytes).

## 2026-07-20 Installer Namespace And Forge Locale Recovery

- Installer root cause: the extension's `backend/__init__.py` made `backend` a
  regular package and shadowed Forge Neo's sibling `backend.args` while the
  extension installer was first on `sys.path`. Removed that marker so both
  trees participate in the `backend` namespace package.
- Locale root cause: the Svelte store fetched `/prompt-agent/api/i18n/locale`
  but discarded its parsed Forge locale. Initial host hints could therefore
  fall back to the browser language and remain English even when Forge used
  `zh_CN`.
- Applied Python locale metadata to `forgeLocale` during preload and after host
  locale events. Added regressions for namespace coexistence and Forge-locale
  precedence over an English browser locale.
- Verification: the real Forge venv ran `install.py` successfully;
  `python tests/run_suite.py --max-skips 20` passed 79 tests with 0 skipped;
  frontend Vitest passed 124 tests and Svelte check reported 0 errors/warnings;
  root browser contracts passed 11 tests; Vite build, `node --check`, and the
  bundle-size check passed (740,420 raw / 213,885 gzip bytes). The configured
  Playwright web-server command could not launch `pnpm@10` on Windows, so the
  same pinned Vite server was started explicitly and all 7 mock Chromium
  scenarios passed.

## 2026-07-20 Gemma 4 12B On-Demand Local Runtime

- Restored `llama-once` as a streaming Pi agent runtime without restoring the
  archived sidecar. Python now owns one loopback-only llama.cpp process while
  the frontend owns the complete agent turn and its tool loop.
- Added explicit turn start/stop boundaries so model calls before and after
  Forge tools reuse the same process. The process is terminated after the final
  reply, failure, abort, or stale interrupted turn by default. A profile toggle
  can keep it resident between replies instead.
- Added server-only MTP draft-model configuration and safe public configured
  flags. Model, mmproj, draft, and executable paths remain absent from browser
  profile responses and stream requests.
- Configured the local machine profile for Gemma 4 12B Q8, its BF16 mmproj and
  MTP draft model under `E:\AI\lmcpp`, with 16K context, full RTX 3090 offload,
  one slot, flash attention, prompt-cache disabled, and reply-end unloading.
- Corrected `E:\AI\lmcpp\start-server.bat` to use the installed mmproj and the
  current llama.cpp MTP flags while binding only to `127.0.0.1`.
- Real verification loaded Gemma on a dynamic loopback port, returned exactly
  `LOCAL_OK`, then reported `stopped: true`; the PID disappeared and GPU memory
  returned to approximately 1.69 GiB baseline. Python passed 82 tests with 0
  skipped; frontend Vitest passed 127 tests and Svelte check reported 0 errors
  or warnings. The generated bundle passed its size budget at 743,468 raw /
  214,508 gzip bytes; browser contracts passed 11 tests and mock Chromium E2E
  passed all 7 scenarios.

## 2026-07-20 Bugfix: Settings Selects Lost Styling

- Symptom: dropdowns/selects in the profile settings window were unusable
  after the minimalist refresh.
- Root cause: the `styles.css` consolidation removed legacy CSS variables
  (`--pa-border`, `--pa-input`, `--pa-ring`, `--pa-background`,
  `--pa-secondary-foreground`, `--pa-muted*`, `--pa-popover*`,
  `--pa-radius-sm`, and the shadcn-meaning `--pa-accent`) that
  `frontend/tailwind.config.ts` maps into Tailwind theme colors used by the
  shared UI primitives (`pa-border-input`, `pa-bg-background`,
  `pa-ring-ring`, etc.).
- Fix: restored every Tailwind-consumed token on the surface root and moved
  the refresh's primary-accent usages to a dedicated `--pa-focus` token to
  avoid the `--pa-accent` semantic collision.
- Regression coverage: new `frontend/tests/style-tokens.test.ts` asserts all
  Tailwind-consumed tokens stay defined in `styles.css`.
- Verification: `pnpm run test` 125 passed across 22 files; `pnpm run build`
  succeeded; `node --check` passed on the generated bundle; manually verified
  against the Vite mock host that the Runtime select changes value and the
  header DropdownMenu opens and renders correctly. The mock Playwright
  webServer script fails under the npm temporary-toolchain wrapper (env issue,
  unrelated to this fix).

## 2026-07-20 Profile Settings Refactor And Teacher Removal

- Root causes: narrow/mobile profile settings were forced into a full-viewport
  layout; controlled profile fields autosaved on every keystroke and normalized
  empty intermediate values back to hard-coded defaults; the retired two-model
  Teacher route and `teacher_mode` redaction field still crossed frontend and
  backend profile contracts.
- Added commit-on-change input/textarea wrappers so identity, endpoint,
  fallback endpoint, and numeric fields remain freely editable until commit.
  Empty required values revert with validation feedback; ordinary typing no
  longer sends one PATCH per keystroke.
- Mobile profile settings now use their persisted floating layout, remain
  draggable like the chat window, and keep resize disabled on narrow/mobile
  viewports. Removed the forced `inset: 0` full-screen CSS path and softened
  warning/tab/form visual hierarchy.
- Removed the Teacher route and `teacher_mode` end to end from frontend
  contracts, state adapter/store/API, profile settings, backend profile
  authority/migration/public contracts, active locale strings, mocks, and
  regression tests. Legacy JSON keys are ignored and disappear on normalized
  writeback; the main active profile remains the sole agent profile.
- Verification: Svelte check reported 0 errors and warnings; frontend Vitest
  passed 141 tests across 22 files; Python unittest passed 85 tests; Vite build
  regenerated `javascript/prompt_agent_90_ui.js` at 751.74 kB raw / 217.59 kB
  gzip; generated and boot scripts passed `node --check`.

## 2026-07-20 Bugfix: Agent Recovery And Edit Resend

- Symptoms: a failed Forge tool call ended the agent turn instead of letting the
  model inspect the error and retry, direct prompt-edit requests could finish
  with advice but no successful `edit_prompt`, and the Pi migration no longer
  exposed the previous user-message edit-and-resend workflow.
- Root causes: the browser controller marked tool errors as terminal, the
  runtime had no bounded completion guard for requested prompt mutations, and
  the migrated UI/session layer omitted transcript rewind and persisted-message
  suffix deletion.
- Fix: tool failures now remain in the single browser-owned Pi loop with a
  visible `retrying` state. Direct mutation requests receive at most two hidden
  corrective follow-ups until `edit_prompt` succeeds, then fail explicitly
  with `prompt_mutation_incomplete` instead of claiming success. Hidden control
  messages and superseded assistant replies are excluded from UI, snapshots,
  and persistence.
- Restored edit and resend by deleting the selected user message and all later
  records in one IndexedDB transaction, replacing the runtime transcript, and
  submitting the edited text and attachments. Cancel restores the pre-existing
  composer draft. Ordinary streaming snapshots retain earlier complete
  history; cleanup of superseded records only runs at correction and terminal
  persistence boundaries.
- Changed files: `frontend/src/agent/agent-runtime.ts`,
  `frontend/src/agent/controller.ts`, `frontend/src/agent/runtime-state.ts`,
  `frontend/src/components/Surface.svelte`,
  `frontend/src/components/WorkingIndicator.svelte`,
  `frontend/src/contracts.ts`, `frontend/src/sessions/repository.ts`,
  `frontend/src/styles.css`, `prompt_agent/i18n.py`, focused frontend tests, and
  rebuilt `javascript/prompt_agent_90_ui.js`.
- Regression coverage includes stale prompt-hash refresh and retry, bounded
  hidden mutation correction, explicit incomplete-mutation failure, transcript
  replacement, IndexedDB suffix deletion, stale snapshot cleanup, ordinary
  streaming-history retention, edit cancellation/draft preservation, and mock
  Chromium edit-and-resend, abort, and refresh interruption flows.
- Verification: `python -m unittest discover -s tests` passed 85 tests;
  frontend `pnpm run test` passed 143 tests across 24 files; focused frontend
  tests passed 61; `pnpm run check` reported 0 errors and two pre-existing
  settings-input warnings; Vite build and bundle-size passed at 752,538 raw /
  217,358 gzip bytes; all Prompt Agent browser scripts passed `node --check`;
  browser contracts passed 11 tests; final targeted Playwright passed all 3
  affected scenarios. The full mock suite passed 6 of 7; its remaining mobile
  settings-window offset assertion and the configured Windows web-server npm
  package-name error are unrelated to this agent-loop/message-history fix.

## 2026-07-20 Critical Acceptance Quality Gates

- Root cause: critical product behavior was distributed across ordinary tests
  without a revisioned source of truth, so stale high-level assertions could
  pressure production code to restore superseded behavior. Local verification
  also relied on manually assembled commands instead of a consistent affected
  versus delivery gate.
- Added `quality/acceptance.json`, shared Python/Vitest/Playwright acceptance
  helpers, expiring flaky-test waivers, and `tools/test_gate.py`. The registry
  governs 11 critical UI, session, agent/provider, local-runtime, security, and
  data-integrity requirements through 26 mapped test references. Affected mode
  warns and skips stale mappings; full mode rejects them. Intentional behavior
  changes explicitly bump the relevant requirement revision.
- Migrated critical tests to observable acceptance scenarios and replaced exact
  mobile geometry assumptions with viewport containment and floating-window
  semantics. Added focused gate self-tests and documented affected, full,
  release, and behavior-change workflows in the repository guidance.
- Verification exposed three gate-environment defects: Python subprocesses on
  Windows did not resolve the `npx.cmd` shim, Node 22 required JSON import
  attributes in the TypeScript helpers, and seven parallel cold Vite
  navigations exceeded the old 10-second Playwright ceiling before assertions
  ran. The gate now resolves Windows executable shims and reports missing tools
  as environment failures; helpers use valid JSON import attributes; the E2E
  ceiling is 30 seconds while all behavioral assertions remain unchanged.
- `python tools/test_gate.py affected` passed with a clean 11-requirement / 26-
  mapping preflight, 55 Python tests, Svelte check with 0 errors and warnings,
  56 focused frontend tests, and all 7 mock-host browser scenarios.
- `python tools/test_gate.py full` passed Python compilation, 93 Python tests,
  11 browser host contracts, Svelte check with 0 errors and warnings, 145
  frontend tests across 22 files, production build, bundle budget at 756,574
  raw / 218,425 gzip bytes, all 7 browser scenarios, and syntax checks for all
  6 Prompt Agent browser scripts.

## 2026-07-20 Bugfix: Stable Floating Windows During Virtual Keyboard Use

- Visible symptom: on Android in landscape, focusing a text field made the chat
  and profile windows jump between positions while the virtual keyboard opened.
- Root cause: each `visualViewport` resize/scroll event clamped the windows into
  the keyboard-reduced viewport. Moving the focused field caused the browser to
  pan again, producing a feedback loop between native focus panning and the
  extension's window correction.
- Fix: while a focused text entry has reduced an otherwise same-width visual
  viewport, retain the last stable window geometry and allow the floating window
  to exceed the temporary keyboard viewport. Normal viewport containment resumes
  after the keyboard closes; rotation and genuine window resizes still update the
  stable viewport. Applied consistently to chat and profile settings without
  persisting the temporary overflow geometry.
- Changed files: `frontend/src/window-interactions.ts`,
  `frontend/src/components/Surface.svelte`,
  `frontend/src/components/ProfileSettings.svelte`, `frontend/src/styles.css`,
  focused window/surface/profile tests, `quality/acceptance.json`, generated
  acceptance documentation, and rebuilt `javascript/prompt_agent_90_ui.js`.
- Verification: pinned Node 22.17.0 / pnpm 10.12.4 focused regression passed 47
  tests; final keyboard-only regression passed 5 tests across 3 files; Svelte
  check reported 0 errors and 0 warnings; `python tools/test_gate.py affected`
  passed 47 Python tests, 46 frontend tests, and 6 browser scenarios with a clean
  preflight; Vite build, bundle-size (757,308 raw / 218,670 gzip bytes), and
  generated bundle syntax check passed.
- Residual gate state: `python tools/test_gate.py full` stopped at preflight on
  seven unrelated stale mappings for concurrent `UI-FEEDBACK-001@2` and
  `SESSION-LIFECYCLE-001@2` behavior changes. Manual full suites confirmed 144 of
  147 frontend tests and 91 of 93 Python tests pass; all reported failures were
  stale-acceptance guards except one unrelated intermittent reasoning-fixture
  assertion. No mapping outside `UI-WINDOW-001` was changed by this fix.

## 2026-07-20 Compact Assistant Turns And Transient Provider Retry

- Visible symptom: one user request could render every Pi model/tool round as a
  separate full assistant block, repeating the role, usage, collapse, and copy
  controls until tool history displaced the final user-facing reply. A transient
  provider HTTP error also emitted a terminal Pi error immediately and ended the
  agent loop.
- Root cause: `Surface.svelte` attached pending tools to the next assistant
  message but did not group consecutive assistant/tool messages into one user
  turn. The custom `/prompt-agent/api/stream` `StreamFn` bypassed provider SDK
  retry behavior and converted every non-OK response or SSE error directly into
  a terminal event.
- Fix: group consecutive assistant/tool rounds into one final response with a
  default-collapsed process drawer containing intermediate text, reasoning,
  tools, aggregate usage, failures, and mutation undo controls. Keep one copy
  action and one live working indicator, suppress duplicate top-level terminal
  errors, and retain a single compact usage display for direct text-only replies.
  Retry network errors and HTTP 408/425/429/500/502/503/504 up to two times with
  bounded exponential backoff, but only before any text, reasoning, or tool-call
  output is emitted; abort and non-transient errors remain immediately terminal.
- Changed files: `frontend/src/components/ProcessDrawer.svelte`,
  `frontend/src/components/Surface.svelte`, `frontend/src/components/WorkingIndicator.svelte`,
  `frontend/src/providers/proxy-stream.ts`, `frontend/src/providers/adapter.ts`,
  `frontend/src/agent/controller.ts`, `frontend/src/styles.css`,
  `prompt_agent/i18n.py`, focused frontend/browser/Python acceptance tests,
  acceptance registry/docs, and rebuilt `javascript/prompt_agent_90_ui.js`.
- Verification: focused Svelte check passed with 0 errors and 0 warnings; 57
  focused frontend tests passed. `python tools/test_gate.py affected` passed 55
  Python tests, 63 mapped frontend tests, and all 7 browser scenarios with a
  clean 11-requirement / 28-mapping preflight. `python tools/test_gate.py full`
  passed Python compilation, 93 Python tests, 11 browser host contracts, Svelte
  check with 0 errors and 0 warnings, 153 frontend tests across 22 files,
  production build, bundle budget at 761,297 raw / 220,210 gzip bytes, all 7
  browser scenarios, and syntax checks for all Prompt Agent browser scripts.
- Residual risk: retries deliberately stop after streaming begins because
  replaying a partial response or tool call could duplicate provider output or
  Forge mutations. A mid-stream transient failure therefore remains visible and
  terminal, with the composer restored for an explicit user retry.

## 2026-07-20 Model Profile Identity, Touch Deletion, And Persistent Launcher

- Visible symptoms: editing the configured Gemini 3.1 Pro profile made Agent
  models report unavailable and switched the settings form to local Gemma
  fields; Base URL appeared uneditable; the per-row deletion menu was unreliable
  on touch screens; opening chat and settings together removed the Prompt Agent
  launcher.
- Root cause: models.dev catalog provenance such as `pioneer` was treated as an
  explicit frontend transport adapter even though the configured transport was
  `gemini-native`. Normalization then excluded that profile from agent-capable
  profiles and selected the local fallback. Deletion depended on a hover/portal
  menu and the confirmation action read the mutable selected profile instead of
  retaining the requested ID. Launcher rendering was conditional on both
  windows being closed.
- Fix: resolve transport only from an explicit profile adapter or the configured
  protocol/runtime, while retaining catalog provider metadata for display.
  Keep the exact remote profile selected through edits. Add a direct touch-safe
  delete action that captures the target ID, waits for server success, and keeps
  the profile with a sanitized error on failure. Keep the draggable launcher
  rendered above both floating windows, compacting it to an icon on mobile while
  a window is open. Existing session records and profile data are not migrated
  or deleted by this fix.
- Changed files: frontend provider registry/capability/controller selection,
  profile store contracts and settings UI, `Surface.svelte`, shared styles and
  translations, focused unit/browser tests, acceptance registry/docs, and the
  rebuilt `javascript/prompt_agent_90_ui.js`.
- Verification: focused Svelte check reported 0 errors and 0 warnings; 62
  focused provider/profile/surface tests passed; all 7 mock-host browser tests
  passed. `python tools/test_gate.py full` passed with a clean 12-requirement / 33-mapping
  preflight, Python compilation, 93 Python tests, 11 browser host contracts, 157
  frontend tests across 22 files, production build, bundle budget at 762,706 raw
  / 220,675 gzip bytes, all 7 browser scenarios, and syntax checks for all six
  Prompt Agent browser scripts.

## 2026-07-21 Truthful Recovered-Tool Status

- Visible symptom: a turn was colored red whenever any intermediate tool failed,
  even when the agent recovered and produced a successful final answer.
- Root cause: `ProcessDrawer.svelte` derived the whole turn's error styling from
  the count of failed tools instead of the final assistant message status.
- Fix: reserve the outer red state for a terminal turn failure and label that
  state explicitly as `Execution failed` / `执行失败`. Keep recovered failures
  visible in the neutral process summary and mark only the individual failed
  tool card as `failed` / `执行失败`.
- Changed files: `frontend/src/components/ProcessDrawer.svelte`,
  `frontend/src/components/ToolCard.svelte`, `frontend/tests/surface.test.ts`,
  `prompt_agent/i18n.py`, `quality/acceptance.json`, and rebuilt
  `javascript/prompt_agent_90_ui.js`.
- Verification: focused surface tests passed 37/37; Svelte check reported 0
  errors and 0 warnings. The affected gate passed 55 Python tests, 93 mapped
  frontend tests, and 7 browser scenarios. The full gate passed 93 Python tests,
  11 browser host contracts, 159 frontend tests across 22 files, all 7 browser
  scenarios, production build, bundle budget at 762,832 raw / 220,767 gzip
  bytes, and all browser-script syntax checks.
- Residual risk: a recovered tool failure remains intentionally visible inside
  the process drawer; only its severity is scoped so it cannot misrepresent the
  final turn outcome.

## 2026-07-21 Cross-Browser Session Synchronization

- Root cause: session and message history was authoritative only in each
  browser's IndexedDB database, so a different browser or device connected to
  the same Forge host had an independent empty history.
- Fix: added a bounded, validated `/prompt-agent/api/sessions/sync` endpoint and
  durable SQLite snapshots under `data/prompt-agent/`. IndexedDB remains the
  immediate local cache and chat stays usable when sync is unavailable. Each
  snapshot carries a revision and content hash; an unchanged stale cache pulls
  the current server version, while divergent stale edits become separately
  visible conflict-copy sessions instead of overwriting either transcript.
  Synchronization runs at mount, new-session creation, and terminal turn
  boundaries and never owns, continues, or replays agent execution.
- Changed files: `backend/prompt_agent/session_sync.py`, API health/registration,
  frontend session schema/repository/sync and controller integration, session
  system/roadmap/README documentation, `SESSION-SYNC-001` acceptance metadata,
  focused Python/frontend tests, mock-host sync coverage, and rebuilt
  `javascript/prompt_agent_90_ui.js`.
- Verification: focused session/controller tests passed 25 frontend and 28
  Python/API/architecture tests; Svelte check reported 0 errors and 0 warnings.
  The affected gate passed 60 Python tests, 97 mapped frontend tests, and all 7
  browser scenarios. The final full gate passed 98 Python tests with 0 skips,
  11 browser host contracts, 163 frontend tests across 23 files, production
  build, bundle budget at 765,477 raw / 221,425 gzip bytes, all 7 mock-host
  browser scenarios, and all browser-script syntax checks.
- Residual scope: synchronization targets browsers connected to the same Forge
  host. The standalone attachment object store and session deletion tombstones
  are not synchronized because the current product has no attachment-history or
  session-deletion UI boundary; message-embedded reference images are included
  in synchronized snapshots. Forge access remains the authentication boundary,
  so an untrusted network requires Forge authentication.

## 2026-07-21 Provider Route And Premature Stream Recovery

- Root cause: the active Gemini profile treated an OpenAI-compatible gateway as
  Gemini Native, so generation targeted a nonexistent native route. Raw
  transport `EndOfStream` failures were also reduced to a generic provider
  error, preventing the frontend's bounded pre-output retry policy from
  recognizing them.
- Fix: changed the active profile to the gateway's verified `/v1` OpenAI
  compatibility endpoint while preserving its protected key, recognized nested
  transport EOF failures as `provider_unexpected_eof`, and made OpenAI URL
  composition preserve explicit compatibility base paths. Added a package
  marker so test-gate imports remain stable after the extension directory move.
- Changed files: `backend/prompt_agent/errors.py`,
  `backend/prompt_agent/provider_adapters/common.py`,
  `backend/prompt_agent/profile_connection.py`, focused provider/API tests, and
  `tests/__init__.py`. The active profile data was updated through the local API.
- Verification: 7 provider-proxy and 20 profile/API tests passed. The affected
  gate passed 68 Python tests, 110 frontend tests, and all 7 browser scenarios.
  The final full gate passed 101 Python tests, 11 browser host contracts, 176
  frontend tests across 24 files, production build, bundle budget at 794,529
  raw / 230,445 gzip bytes, all 7 browser scenarios, and Svelte check with 0
  errors and 0 warnings. A live connection probe passed, and a real streamed
  request returned `OK` followed by `done`.
- Residual risk: upstream transport interruptions can still exhaust all three
  safe pre-output retries; once any model output or tool call is observed, the
  request remains intentionally non-replayable.

## 2026-07-21 Connection Mode And Browser Cache Cleanup

- Root cause: model profiles exposed protocol and runtime as independent
  controls even though only OpenAI-compatible HTTP, Gemini Native HTTP, and
  local llama.cpp one-shot execution were supported product modes. Legacy
  Anthropic, OpenRouter, and llama-endpoint branches remained selectable or
  routable, while an unused IndexedDB profile cache duplicated the server-owned
  profile store.
- Fix: replaced the two low-level selectors with one atomic connection-type
  selector for the three supported modes, removed the unused Anthropic and
  OpenRouter adapters, collapsed llama-endpoint into the remote compatibility
  migration path, and added safe normalization for existing profile JSON.
  IndexedDB schema v3 deletes only the obsolete profile-cache store; sessions
  remain an immediate browser cache synchronized to server SQLite, and profile
  configuration remains server JSON with DPAPI-protected credentials.
- Changed files: frontend profile settings/contracts/adapters/profile store and
  IndexedDB schema/repository, backend profile contracts/storage/migration and
  provider registry/adapters, i18n, architecture/roadmap documentation,
  acceptance metadata, focused Python/frontend/browser tests, and rebuilt
  `javascript/prompt_agent_90_ui.js`. Deleted the frontend and backend
  Anthropic/OpenRouter adapter modules.
- Verification: `python tools/test_gate.py affected` passed 68 Python tests,
  111 mapped frontend tests, all 7 browser scenarios, and Svelte check with 0
  errors and 0 warnings. `python tools/test_gate.py full` passed 101 Python
  tests with 0 skips, all browser host contracts, the complete frontend suite,
  production build and bundle budget, all 7 browser scenarios, and all
  browser-script syntax checks.
- Residual scope: legacy profile values are normalized on server load instead
  of preserving removed modes. Cross-device sessions still use the existing
  SQLite synchronization contract; no session history is deleted by this
  cleanup.

## 2026-07-21 Compact Prompt Diff And Stream Completion

- Root cause: confirmed prompt diffs rendered every tag change as a separate
  labeled row, producing a tiring vertical list and interleaving prompt pools.
  The OpenAI-compatible adapter also required a `[DONE]` sentinel even when the
  provider had already returned an explicit non-empty `finish_reason`, causing
  some compatibility gateways to be reported as premature EOF after a complete
  response.
- Fix: grouped changes by prompt pool and change kind, placed the tag pool
  first, rendered same-kind tags as one comma-separated sequence, and kept
  natural-language, special-syntax, and unknown changes below it. The provider
  adapter now accepts either `[DONE]` or an explicit `finish_reason` as terminal;
  streams with neither marker still fail as `provider_unexpected_eof`.
- Changed files: `frontend/src/components/PromptChangeCard.svelte`,
  `frontend/src/styles.css`, `frontend/tests/surface.test.ts`,
  `backend/prompt_agent/provider_adapters/openai_compatible.py`,
  `tests/test_prompt_agent_provider_proxy.py`, and rebuilt
  `javascript/prompt_agent_90_ui.js`.
- Verification: focused provider EOF/completion tests passed; the focused
  Svelte surface suite passed all 38 tests. `python tools/test_gate.py affected`
  passed. `python tools/test_gate.py full` passed acceptance preflight, 102
  Python tests, browser host contracts, Svelte check with 0 errors and 0
  warnings, all 178 frontend tests, production build, the bundle budget at
  792,257 raw / 230,174 gzip bytes, all 7 browser scenarios, and browser-script
  syntax checks.
- Residual scope: moved tags retain their existing secondary semantic row; the
  compact comma-separated treatment intentionally prioritizes added and removed
  tag readability. A provider close without `[DONE]` remains successful only
  when the provider explicitly supplied a non-empty completion reason.

## 2026-07-21 Assistant Response Visual Unification

- Root cause: assistant responses used a full-height square-ended focus rail
  beside rounded process, diff, and composer surfaces. Prompt tags also retained
  chip-like framing while natural-language changes used plain highlighted text,
  making one response read as two unrelated visual systems.
- Fix: replaced the full-height assistant rail with a short rounded response
  marker and removed tag chip borders, padding, and backgrounds. Tag changes
  remain comma-separated and monospaced, while both tags and natural language
  now share the same addition/removal text treatment.
- Changed files: `frontend/src/styles.css`, `frontend/tests/surface.test.ts`, and
  rebuilt `javascript/prompt_agent_90_ui.js`.
- Verification: the focused Svelte surface suite passed all 38 tests,
  `pnpm run check` reported 0 errors and 0 warnings, the production build passed,
  and `python tools/test_gate.py affected` passed all selected Python, frontend,
  browser, build, bundle-budget, and syntax checks.
- Residual scope: the short response marker intentionally remains as a subtle
  assistant-identity cue. Process and prompt-change surfaces retain the existing
  product radius tokens.

## 2026-07-21 Enter To Send Shortcut

- Root cause: the Prompt Agent composer intercepted `Ctrl/Cmd+Enter`, which also
  triggered Forge WebUI generation. Sending therefore required a conflicting
  shortcut.
- Changed `frontend/src/components/Surface.svelte` so an unmodified `Enter`
  submits or stops the active request. `Shift+Enter` remains a newline, while
  `Ctrl/Cmd+Enter`, other modifiers, and IME composition are left to their
  native behavior. Added the focused regression in
  `frontend/tests/surface.test.ts` and rebuilt `javascript/prompt_agent_90_ui.js`.
- Verification: the focused surface suite passed 39 tests; Svelte check reported
  0 errors and 0 warnings; the production bundle completed at 792.67 kB raw and
  230.67 kB gzip; `python tools/test_gate.py full` passed 102 Python tests, 180
  frontend tests, all 7 browser scenarios, bundle checks, and browser-script
  syntax checks.
- Residual scope: during an active Prompt Agent request, unmodified `Enter`
  retains the existing stop behavior.

## 2026-07-23 Profile Hot Reload

- Root cause: a conversation created its Pi runtime from a profile snapshot
  only when the session opened. Later profile edits and active-model changes
  reached the profile store and server, but the next request could retain the
  session's old profile ID and frontend model metadata. Manual Save also did
  not order itself after earlier fire-and-forget autosave requests.
- Changed `frontend/src/agent/controller.ts` to rebind the idle conversation
  and rebuild its lightweight runtime from the latest active profile before a
  send. Changed `frontend/src/components/ProfileSettings.svelte` so explicit
  Save finishes with the complete visible profile as a server-confirmed write
  barrier. Added focused controller coverage, advanced
  `MODEL-PROFILE-001` to revision 3, reviewed its mapped tests, and rebuilt
  `javascript/prompt_agent_90_ui.js`.
- Verification: 43 focused frontend tests passed; Svelte check reported 0
  errors and 0 warnings; the production bundle completed at 793.04 kB raw and
  230.71 kB gzip. The affected gate passed 68 Python tests, 113 selected
  frontend tests, and all 7 browser scenarios. The full gate passed 102 Python
  tests, all 181 frontend tests, the production build and bundle budget, all 7
  browser scenarios, and browser-script syntax checks.
- Residual scope: profile changes intentionally take effect at the next idle
  send boundary. An in-flight provider request is never switched mid-stream.

## 2026-07-23 Grounded Image Instructions And Mobile Multi-Select

- Root cause: the system prompt did not require the model to establish visible
  image facts before rewriting Forge prompts, so a vision model could jump from
  a partial reading to unsupported edits. The attachment input already declared
  HTML `multiple`, but some mobile media-picker routes still presented a
  single-selection flow.
- Changed `frontend/src/agent/controller.ts` to require a per-image factual
  inventory of visible content, visual style, and composition before prompt
  changes, including uncertainty boundaries and multi-image separation. Image
  caption requests now produce one concise detailed English NL version and one
  evidence-equivalent purely Chinese version. Both follow content, style, then
  composition as one continuous context rather than disconnected fragments. Changed
  `frontend/src/components/Surface.svelte` to prefer the native open-file picker
  with explicit multi-selection and retain the standard multi-file input as a
  compatibility fallback.
- Added `IMAGE-INPUT-001` acceptance coverage and focused controller/surface
  regressions. The focused suites passed 55 tests and Svelte check reported 0
  errors and 0 warnings. The affected gate passed 21 Python tests, 114 selected
  frontend tests, and all 7 browser scenarios. The final full gate passed 102
  Python tests, all frontend tests, the production build and bundle budget, all
  7 browser scenarios, and browser-script syntax checks.
- Residual scope: the final picker UI is controlled by the mobile browser and
  operating system. Browsers without the native picker API use the existing
  standards-based multi-file input and still support incremental attachment.

## 2026-07-23 Provider EOF Retry Classification

- Root cause: an unexpected provider EOF retained the successful upstream HTTP
  status 200. The frontend checked any present status code before its structured
  provider error code, so `provider_unexpected_eof` was incorrectly treated as
  non-retryable. The frontend retry-code names also omitted the backend's actual
  `provider_connection_error` and `provider_timeout` classifications.
- Changed `frontend/src/providers/proxy-stream.ts` so structured transient codes
  take priority over the accompanying HTTP status and aligned the connection and
  timeout codes. The existing safe pre-output policy remains: at most three
  attempts with capped 500 ms, 1 s exponential delays; no replay after text,
  reasoning, or tool output begins.
- Added regressions for repeated HTTP-200 unexpected EOF recovery and the capped
  exponential delay sequence. Advanced `SESSION-LIFECYCLE-001` to revision 3
  and reviewed all mapped lifecycle tests. The affected gate passed 28 Python
  tests, 116 selected frontend tests, and all 7 browser scenarios. The full gate
  passed 102 Python tests, all frontend tests, the production build and bundle
  budget, all 7 browser scenarios, and browser-script syntax checks.

## 2026-07-27 Parallel Read Tools, Compact Prompt Results, And On-Demand Skills

- Root causes: the agent runtime explicitly selected sequential tool execution
  and all Forge tools were marked sequential, so even independent reads waited
  for one another. Usage projection discarded provider cache counters. Prompt
  results hid the useful receipt inside a disclosure while devoting space to
  moved and normalized groups whose ordering was not actionable. A server skill
  endpoint and browser loader existed, but no active Pi tool exposed them.
- Changed the runtime and tool metadata so a model-returned batch of independent
  read tools runs concurrently, while any batch containing a Forge mutation is
  serialized. The process drawer stays collapsed by default; the prompt receipt
  is always visible before the final answer and shows only added and removed
  fragments. Usage now renders input, output, and cache-read tokens. Added the
  bounded `load_skill` tool with `danbooru_tags`, `anima_dit`, and
  `forge_couple` guides, including host-side reuse of successfully loaded skills.
  The Forge Couple guide documents the locally installed 7.1.0 prompt-region
  contract without claiming control of that extension's UI settings.
- Advanced `AGENT-TOOLS-001`, `UI-FEEDBACK-001`, and `PROMPT-DIFF-001`, and added
  `PROMPT-SKILL-001` with focused concurrency, UI, host-bridge, and skill tests.
  The affected gate passed 48 Python tests, 118 selected frontend tests, and all
  7 browser scenarios. The full gate passed 104 Python tests, 11 browser host
  contracts, 186 frontend tests, Svelte check with 0 errors and 0 warnings, the
  production build and bundle budget, all 7 browser scenarios, and every browser
  script syntax check.
- Residual scope: `load_skill` supplies prompt-writing knowledge only. It does
  not enable Forge Couple or change its mode, separator, orientation, or mapping;
  those UI settings remain user-controlled. Live Forge was not restarted during
  this increment; verification used the production bundle and mock-host browser
  acceptance suite.

## 2026-07-27 Borderless Chat Transcript

- Root cause: the earlier compact-chat work changed visibility and ordering but
  retained the previous visual containers. The assistant accent rail, process
  outline, nested process/tool rails, prompt-diff panel, count pills, header
  divider, and highlighted diff backgrounds still produced a card-inside-card
  appearance even with the process collapsed.
- Changed `frontend/src/styles.css` so the chat reads as one continuous surface.
  Assistant answers, the process disclosure, expanded reasoning and tool output,
  and the always-visible prompt change receipt now use spacing, type weight, and
  semantic text color without decorative borders, rails, container fills, or
  count pills. The outer movable window and composer retain boundaries because
  they are interactive controls. Windows forced-colors mode retains its explicit
  prompt-change outline so the receipt remains distinguishable without color.
- Advanced `UI-FEEDBACK-001` to revision 5 and `PROMPT-DIFF-001` to revision 3.
  Added a focused style regression and reviewed the mapped surface/runtime tests.
  The 43 focused frontend tests passed, Svelte check reported 0 errors and 0
  warnings, and the desktop mock-host browser flow passed with a fresh
  `chat-messages.png` visual capture. The affected gate passed 48 Python tests,
  118 selected frontend tests, and all 7 browser scenarios. The final full gate
  passed 104 Python tests, 11 browser host contracts, 187 frontend tests, Svelte
  check with 0 errors and 0 warnings, the production build and bundle budget,
  all 7 browser scenarios, and every browser-script syntax check.
- Opened the running Forge instance at `127.0.0.1:7860` in a fresh headless
  Chromium session without sending a message or mutating Forge state. The live
  chat loaded the rebuilt bundle, reported no header divider, and rendered a
  restored prompt-change/tool/cache/final-answer turn as a continuous borderless
  transcript. A final `real-forge-borderless.png` capture records that state.
- Residual scope: profile settings, modal popovers, the outer floating-window
  boundary, form fields, and image controls retain borders where they communicate
  interaction or containment. This increment targets the conversation transcript
  and does not flatten every control in the extension.

## 2026-07-28 Stable Send And Separate Stop Controls

- Root cause: `Surface.svelte` cleared the draft and then awaited session setup,
  attachment materialization, controller connection, and profile/session refresh
  before the controller published `activeRequestId`. During that gap the UI gave
  no working feedback. Once active state arrived, an `{active ? Stop : Send}`
  branch replaced the primary send button in the same screen position. A retry
  click could therefore land on Stop, and unmodified Enter explicitly called
  `stop()` during an active response.
- Changed `frontend/src/components/Surface.svelte` to set a synchronous local
  submission latch before any await, ignore duplicate submissions, and render
  immediate Sending feedback. The primary send button now remains the same DOM
  control and screen target throughout submission. It is disabled while busy;
  Stop appears as a separate, visually secondary control beside it. Enter during
  an active or pending request no longer aborts. Drafts typed during generation
  remain available for the next send.
- Changed `frontend/src/styles.css` to give only the short pre-activation state a
  visible spinner while preserving reduced-motion behavior, and to keep Stop a
  secondary error-colored action rather than a replacement primary button.
  Added delayed-submission unit coverage and a browser assertion that the exact
  send DOM node survives the transition to an active request. Advanced
  `UI-FEEDBACK-001` to revision 6 with an explicit `submission` scenario.
- Regression-first evidence: the focused tests initially failed because the
  active state exposed only Stop and the delayed pre-activation state exposed no
  busy feedback. After the implementation, the two focused cases passed.
- `python tools/test_gate.py affected`: passed 48 Python tests, Svelte check with
  0 errors and 0 warnings, 119 affected frontend tests, all 7 Playwright
  scenarios, and acceptance validation with 18 requirements / 53 mappings.
- `python tools/test_gate.py full`: passed 104 Python tests, 11 browser-host
  contracts, Svelte check with 0 errors and 0 warnings, 188 frontend tests, the
  production bundle and gzip budgets, all 7 Playwright scenarios, and all
  browser-script syntax checks.

## 2026-07-28 Natural-Language Prompt Write Enforcement
- Root cause/fix: image-style directives and explicit prose requests allowed tag-only writes; intent routing and pre-write validation now require new substantive NL while preserving tags/syntax. `PROMPT-TOOLKIT-001@2` adds `natural-language-write`.
- Regression-first focused tests passed; affected passed 48 Python/121 frontend/7 browser tests, and full passed 104 Python/11 host/190 frontend/Svelte 0/0/build/budget/7 Playwright/acceptance 18/54.

## 2026-07-28 Danbooru Wiki Default and Concrete Style Brainstorming
- Root cause: batch inspection defaulted Wiki off and URL-only results counted as research; abstract aesthetics were copied instead of expanded. Defaults now include Wiki bodies across Python/API/host/schema, runtime requires non-empty bodies, and system/Anima guidance translates style labels into concrete visual candidates.
- Regression-first default tests failed as expected, then targeted tests passed; affected passed 48 Python, 121 frontend and 7 browser tests, and full passed 104 Python, 12 host, 190 frontend, Svelte 0/0, build/budget, 7 Playwright, syntax, and acceptance 18/56.

## 2026-07-28 Agentic Danbooru Wiki and Tag Group Navigation
- Root cause/fix: tag tools could read one exact Wiki but could not search arbitrary Wiki/Group titles or expose next hops. Added validated Wiki search and batch inspection tools across Python/API/host/frontend; DText references are deduplicated and capped at 80, bodies at 12,000 characters, and Agent policy follows only relevant inspected branches.
- Regression-first failures covered missing tools and routes. Live `frutiger_aero` inspection found 20 references and followed `tag_group:visual_aesthetic` to 59 bounded entries; affected passed 50 Python/121 frontend/7 browser tests, and full passed 106 Python/13 host/190 frontend/Svelte 0/0/build/budget/7 Playwright/acceptance 18/57.

## 2026-07-28 FIFO Follow-up Queue
- Root cause/fix: active requests disabled Send and silently retained text. The composer now queues up to eight FIFO follow-ups, shows/removes them in a borderless list, advances after success, and pauses after failure, cancellation, or preparation-time stop.
- Focused tests cover ordering, immediate acknowledgement, removal, failure resume, and preparation-time cancellation. Affected passed 50 Python/124 frontend/7 browser tests; full passed 106 Python/13 host/193 frontend/Svelte 0/0/build/budget/7 Playwright/acceptance 18/58.
