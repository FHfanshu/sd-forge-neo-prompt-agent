# SD Forge Neo Prompt Agent Roadmap

## Purpose

This roadmap governs the migration from the archived sidecar runtime to a
frontend Pi agent, a thin Python security boundary, synchronized SQLite history,
and IndexedDB session caches.

Decision priority is:

1. user experience;
2. stability and data integrity;
3. performance;
4. maintainability and operability;
5. new capability.

Security and privacy are invariants. API keys, decrypted secrets, arbitrary
local paths, and privileged Forge operations never move into browser storage.

## Product Boundary

The product is `SD Forge Neo Prompt Agent`, a single-agent prompt assistant
embedded in Forge Neo.

The frontend owns:

- the Pi agent loop and generation state;
- streaming, reasoning, tool-call, and abort UI;
- IndexedDB session cache and preferences;
- provider/model/profile selection.

Python owns:

- Forge extension registration and privileged operations;
- provider secret storage and request authorization;
- streaming provider proxying;
- profile authority;
- durable synchronized session snapshots.

The migration must not introduce another Kotlin, Node, or Bun sidecar, a second
agent loop, tool leases, browser bridge claims, server ownership of agent
execution, turn-event replay, or refresh-time continuation of old execution.

## Architecture Invariants

- `PromptAgentRuntime` is the only source of generation state.
- Svelte stores map runtime state; components do not create a second state
  machine.
- Provider-specific request logic stays out of Svelte components.
- Every Forge tool is one validated request and one structured response.
- Python revalidates every tool argument and never trusts browser paths or model
  identifiers.
- API keys are decrypted only for the request that needs them.
- SQLite is authoritative for synchronized history; IndexedDB is the local cache
  and remains usable when synchronization is unavailable.
- Refresh persists partial content, marks unfinished messages interrupted, and
  never re-executes an old tool call.
- Local process state is independent of agent session state.
- Compatibility reads are isolated in migration modules; there is no dual-write
  legacy runtime.

## Phase 0: Freeze The Old Runtime

Status: complete.

Artifacts:

```text
branch: kt
tag: kt-final
commit: b016c88
```

The verified baseline passed 240 Python tests, 146 frontend tests, Svelte
checks, the Vite build, bundle budget, and browser syntax checks.

## Phase 1: Audit And Migration Contract

Status: complete.

Deliverables:

- `docs/archive/current-architecture-audit.md`;
- `docs/archive/kt-runtime-migration.md`;
- old runtime call chains, schemas, build flow, and deletion dependencies;
- explicit Pi version and licensing notes.

Exit criteria:

- the audit names all sources of ownership, lease, replay, and provider state;
- deletion prerequisites are documented;
- the roadmap no longer requires the archived runtime on `main`.

## Phase 2: New Skeleton

Status: complete.

Create and compile:

```text
frontend/src/agent/
frontend/src/providers/
frontend/src/tools/
frontend/src/sessions/
backend/prompt_agent/
```

Add shared errors, API contracts, logging, health, and lifecycle entrypoints.
Keep the current Svelte surface usable while replacing its runtime boundary.

Exit criteria:

- frontend check, tests, and build pass;
- Python compile and focused API tests pass;
- no new ownership or replay protocol exists.

## Phase 3: Minimal Pi Loop

Status: complete.

Integrate pinned, mutually compatible versions of:

```text
@earendil-works/pi-agent-core
@earendil-works/pi-ai
```

Implement `PromptAgentRuntime` with single-turn streaming, event mapping, abort,
reset, destroy, and normalized errors. Use a proxy stream function so the
browser never receives provider secrets.

Exit criteria:

- one streaming conversation completes without starting the archived sidecar;
- abort closes the provider request and restores usable composer state;
- failed requests produce a terminal runtime state;
- runtime destroy aborts work and removes subscribers.

Verified by focused runtime/controller tests and mock-host browser coverage for
success, provider failure, abort, later-submission recovery, and destroy.

## Phase 4: Thin Python Provider Proxy

Status: complete.

Implement provider/profile reads, encrypted secret injection, streaming
forwarding, cancellation propagation, health tests, request IDs, and sanitized
errors under `/prompt-agent/api`.

Exit criteria:

- plaintext saved keys never appear in frontend responses or persistence;
- OpenAI-compatible streaming works end to end;
- disconnect and abort close upstream work;
- logs exclude authorization and sensitive bodies.

Verified with fake upstream transports covering text, reasoning, tool calls,
usage, malformed streams, HTTP failures, cancellation, cleanup, request IDs,
and sanitized logging.

## Phase 5: Provider Adapters

Status: complete.

Add frontend adapters for:

```text
OpenAI Compatible
Gemini
```

Normalize capabilities, messages, tools, attachments, reasoning, usage, stream
events, and errors.

Exit criteria:

- provider differences exist only in adapter modules and Python proxy helpers;
- each adapter has contract tests for text, tools, errors, and abort;
- unsupported capabilities are explicit in the UI.

OpenRouter and other Chat Completions gateways use the OpenAI-compatible path;
there is no provider-branded frontend transport layer. Local llama.cpp one-shot
support described by the original phase was removed in Phase 13.

## Phase 6: Forge Agent Tools

Status: complete.

Migrate, in order:

```text
read_prompt
edit_prompt
read_generation_parameters
apply_generation_parameters
search_resources
inspect_resource
search_danbooru_tags
inspect_danbooru_tags
related_danbooru_tags
search_danbooru_wikis
inspect_danbooru_wikis
```

Every tool needs a frontend TypeBox schema, backend validation, timeout,
AbortSignal, structured error, user-readable error, and permission boundary.

Exit criteria:

- no claim, release, bridge ID, lease token, or owner ID is used;
- stale prompt mutations remain hash guarded;
- failed or aborted tools do not leave the runtime blocked.

Frontend TypeBox schemas and Python validation cover all eleven listed tools.
Positive/negative prompts share a required `field` selector; Forge
catalogs share `kind`. Prompt
and generation mutations are freshness guarded, nested patch and generation
values are revalidated, and catalog output is a logical-ID allowlist. Full
prompt overwrite is allowed only when the current field is empty. Danbooru tag
and Wiki tools execute through the existing resource host path. Wiki inspection
returns bounded bodies and parsed next-hop references so the agent can explore
relevant Wiki and Tag Group branches without an unbounded crawler. `ask_teacher`
is not part of the agent tool surface. Browser-host prompt and generation tools call
the Python validation boundary before reading or mutating Forge DOM.

## Phase 7: Profiles

Status: complete.

Make Python profile storage authoritative and expose list, read, create, update,
delete, duplicate, set-default, models, and connection-test APIs.

Exit criteria:

- CRUD and default selection survive refresh;
- DPAPI round trips are covered;
- frontend caches contain no secret values;
- old profile import is isolated and idempotent.

The compatibility importer accepts an explicit snapshot only and performs no
legacy file discovery or `.loom` access.

## Phase 8: IndexedDB Sessions

Status: complete.

Create database `sd-forge-neo-prompt-agent` with versioned stores for sessions,
messages, attachments, and runtime preferences.

Exit criteria:

- session and message CRUD pass;
- streaming messages update without duplicate writes;
- refresh restores history and selection;
- unfinished messages become `interrupted`;
- no old stream or tool call resumes after refresh;
- multi-tab behavior is informational only.

Database version 3 covers sessions, messages, attachments, and preferences;
the unused profile cache was removed because Python profile storage is
authoritative. Refresh interruption and stable streaming upserts are covered
by repository tests. Browser E2E also verifies durable
partial content, interruption after reload, no provider/tool replay, and a
usable composer for the next submission.

## Phase 9: Remove Archived Runtime

Status: complete.

Delete from `main` after dependency searches are empty:

- managed sidecar and installer;
- Terrarium package/configuration and requirements;
- frontend KT client and runtime controller;
- bridge claim/release and lease renewal;
- single active session ownership and 409 recovery;
- follow-up queue, branch runtime, runtime event log, and replay cursors;
- old provider runtime and contract tests.

Exit criteria:

- no active import, route, build step, test, or startup path references the old
  runtime;
- default build and launch do not create or inspect `.loom`;
- historical comparison remains available through `kt` and `kt-final`.

The active dependency audit found no archived runtime import, route, build,
test, or startup path. A startup sentinel also confirmed API registration does
not create or inspect `.loom`. An architecture regression test rejects archived
KT proxy, sidecar, claim/release, replay, runtime-lock, and old session-store
execution markers from active files.

## Phase 10: Complete Naming Migration

Status: complete.

Use these active identifiers:

```text
SD Forge Neo Prompt Agent
sd-forge-neo-prompt-agent
prompt_agent
prompt-agent
PromptAgent
PromptAgentRuntime
/prompt-agent/api
window.__SD_FORGE_NEO_PROMPT_AGENT__
```

Old names remain only in Git history, migration documentation, negative
architecture assertions, and isolated one-time storage compatibility constants.
The root license is MIT. Branch `kt` and tag `kt-final` keep the archived
runtime as a frozen historical lesson and are not part of the active product.

## Phase 11: Cross-Browser Session Synchronization

Status: complete.

Persist revisioned session/message snapshots in server-side SQLite while keeping
IndexedDB as the immediate local cache. Synchronize at mount, session creation,
and terminal turn boundaries. The server stores history only and never owns,
continues, or replays agent execution. Divergent stale revisions create visible
conflict-copy sessions instead of overwriting either transcript.

Exit criteria:

- a second browser connected to the same Forge host restores session history;
- synchronization failure does not prevent local cached chat use;
- stale concurrent writes preserve both transcripts;
- refresh and synchronization never replay provider or Forge tool work;
- identifiers, ownership links, statuses, counts, and payload sizes are validated.

## Phase 12: Hybrid Prompt Toolkit And Confirmed Diffs

Status: in progress.

Add a deterministic, read-only `prompt_toolkit` for hybrid natural-language and
Danbooru-tag prompts. Prompt cleanup requests must run the toolkit before the
hash-guarded `edit_prompt` write. Successful writes return confirmed before and
after evidence, and the chat renders a compact labeled red/green semantic diff
before the final answer. Live negative-prompt activation and CFG state are part
of read/write freshness and effectiveness reporting.

Implemented:

- lossless hybrid parsing with NL, tag, special-syntax, and unknown pools;
- bounded analyze, split, deduplicate, sort, normalize, validate, and compose;
- enforced toolkit-before-write Agent Loop ordering;
- live negative activation hash and changed-but-inactive reporting;
- persisted tool-result-derived semantic evidence and compact add/remove diff UI;
- a continuous borderless chat transcript that uses spacing and typography
  instead of nested process, tool-result, and prompt-diff cards or rails;
- immediate send acknowledgement with a position-stable primary send control
  and a separate secondary stop control, preventing delayed mode-swap aborts;
- a compact FIFO follow-up queue at the composer: successful turns advance it,
  while failure or cancellation keeps pending work visible, removable, and resumable;
- on-demand `load_skill` guidance for Danbooru tags, Anima DiT prompts, and
  Forge Couple regional/multi-character prompting;
- intent-aware natural-language prompt writes: explicit NL requests and
  attached-image style transfers require a new substantive prose block unless
  the user explicitly asks for tags only, with tag-only substitutions rejected
  before they can mutate Forge state;
- concurrent same-turn read-only tool batches while every batch containing a
  live Forge mutation remains sequential.

Remaining:

- explicit per-profile prompting dialect and preferred-layout controls;
- confirmed inverse-diff undo with truthful history;
- real-Forge visual verification for narrow mobile and model-specific negative
  activation variants.

## Phase 13: Context Diet And Remote-Only Providers

Status: complete.

Reduce per-request cost and remove the unused local inference stack:

- progressive tool disclosure: a small always-on core plus a `load_tools`
  meta-tool that reveals the `image`, `forge_resources`, and `danbooru` groups
  only when needed, with attachment and background-lookup turns auto-revealing
  their groups;
- a consolidated system prompt with duplicated image and reply-style rules
  removed;
- a single frontend provider capability table replacing the three
  proxy-identical adapter modules;
- removal of the local `llama-once` runtime, local reference-image analysis, and
  their profile fields, routes, and UI, with legacy local profiles migrating to
  disabled remote profiles.

Exit criteria:

- the always-on tool surface is the core set and grouped tools stay hidden until
  requested;
- no local model module, route, profile field, or control remains;
- remote OpenAI-compatible and Gemini behavior is unchanged.

## Quality Gates

Critical acceptance is versioned in `quality/acceptance.json`. High-level UI,
session, agent/provider, security, and data-integrity tests map to an acceptance
revision and scenario. Ordinary unit tests remain lightweight and do not need a
product requirement ID.

During development, run the affected gate:

```powershell
python tools/test_gate.py affected
```

Before delivery, run the full gate:

```powershell
python tools/test_gate.py full
```

Stale acceptance mappings warn and skip in `affected`, but block `full`. Exact
pixel or DOM-implementation assertions are not allowed in high-level browser
tests unless the acceptance registry explicitly requires them. Flaky acceptance
tests may be waived for at most 14 days.

## Definition Of Done

A phase is complete only when:

- user-visible success, failure, abort, refresh, and recovery behavior match its
  acceptance criteria;
- focused regression tests cover the changed boundary;
- generated assets are rebuilt rather than edited;
- secrets and raw private content are absent from logs and audit records;
- applicable CI-equivalent checks pass;
- critical acceptance mappings are current and all required scenarios have evidence;
- `AUDIT.md` records changed files, commands, outcomes, and residual risk.
